  textContent: 'Hey there!



    We found an old hard drive and managed to unlock
    some of the files (a few had empty passwords). However, we couldn''t open the
    executable files and didn''t find much else, so we haven''t made much progress.



    We''re
    hoping someone with more expertise can dig deeper into this!



    Tips:


    Files:

    You
    can right-click files to create shortcuts on the desktop.


    Notes:

    Only
    your notes are being saved in between sessions, you should write down anything
    you find worth remembering.

    Use an arrow key to unselect the whole text.

    It
    does not seem like you can use Ctrl + Z, so be careful!'
