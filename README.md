Hey there,

Stead (my friend) and I, Tidali, are excited to share our small project from the Game Off 2024 jam.
Take all the time you want—it’s designed to be played at your own pace.

Stead focused mostly on drawing, sketching, and writing dialogue. He also handled most of the app designs, kept the GDD organized, and made sure we stayed on track.
I spent most of my time coding, polishing Stead’s code to make the game work smoothly. I also composed the entire soundtrack and created or sourced all the audio, including music and sound effects.
